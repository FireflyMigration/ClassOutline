<h1>Class Outline Control Readme</h1>
<div>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Adds a new Window (available from Other Windows) called Class Outline, that shows the hierarchy of the currently viewed c# class, and any inner classes<br/>
        The right-click menu allows navigation to various aspects of the code structure in general and some specific navigation useful for Firefly(c) Business classes: namely the ability to open the Designer of any/all views within the class
    </p>
